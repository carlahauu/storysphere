## Inspiration
Many of my friends are book writers who all had one struggle in common. They all agreed that they were annoyed that they did not have a single place to store all the information about their book. 

## What it does
With this tool, all of your story's information is stored all in one place. From your characters' details to your chapters' plot points, this tool is here to assist all writers. This tool also sparks inspiration by asking certain questions. For example, our world-building tab. 

## How we built it
I used Figma first to prototype the UI of this website! Then, I created all the Django files I would need for this project. Then, I started working on the template HTML files needed. Once I got most of the UI done, I moved onto working on more of the technical aspects through Django. I used both class-based views and function-based views and then connected them to the urls.py. 

## Challenges we ran into
1. I originally wanted each to be stored as a Markdown file. However, I was not sure how to convert it into Markdown files. Due to the time limit, I wasn't able to figure this out, so I went with a different approach. 
2. I originally wanted users to be able to log in and log out of accounts depending on which story they want to work on. After I logged in, however, an error was thrown back at me. Due to the time limit, I realized that I had to drop this idea and just move on. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the overall design and graphics of this project. I am also proud that I was able to get this project finished by the deadline, despite currently being sick and going insane from a headache. This was, by far, the biggest project I have ever worked on as a beginner developer. 

## What we learned
I learned many things this weekend. As a new developer, I wasn't really familiar with Django at the start of this project. 

By the end, I got much more familiar with working with all the different files within Django. Additionally, I learned to use CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView, etc. 
## What's next for StorySphere
There are many changes that I would like to make with StorySphere. I aim to polish this tool a lot. For example, making updating details of the chapters and characters easier to understand. I also want to be able to make all the information stored in Markdown files or allow users to save all the information as a PDF. As I learn more, I hope I can make the front end more appealing through React.
